# 🚀 Azure Data Engineering Project : Advanced ADF Pipelines


## Overview

This repository contains an **advanced Azure Data Factory project** that explores how to design and automate **modern data pipelines**.  
The goal is to practice real-world data engineering scenarios  including **incremental ingestion**, **API data integration**, and **GitHub CI/CD**  while following Azure best practices.

It’s a learning-oriented, hands-on project inspired by professional Azure Data Engineering workflows.



## Main Objectives

- Build and orchestrate pipelines in **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**
- Load and store data in **Azure SQL Database**
- Ingest data from multiple sources (flat files, REST APIs)
- Implement **incremental loading** with JSON watermarks
- Handle **pagination** and **API parameters** dynamically
- Use **ADF variables, parameters, ForEach, and Lookup** activities
- Integrate ADF with **GitHub** for version control and CI/CD



## Project Components Implemented

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Azure Data Factory** | Main orchestration service (pipelines, datasets, linked services) |
| **Azure SQL Database** | Target data store for ingestion and transformations |
| **REST API Source** | Example of external data ingestion (with pagination logic) |
| **GitHub Integration** | Source control, branching, and CI/CD setup |
| **Incremental Ingestion** | Load new data using JSON-based watermark tracking |
